## Quality Standards:

### Efiiciency

- In order to have a greater performance, the application will refresh the temperature of the countries periodically instead of refreshing it every time the user enters the application.
- The countries will be sent to the client in a single request and then will be filtered in the client.

### Maintainability

- The code will be written in english.
- The code will be using a linter and a formatter.
- The backend has a domain architecture.
- The frontend will have a component architecture.
- We will modularize the code as much as possible.
- We will use a git flow.

### Portability

- The frontend will be independent of the backend.
- The backend will be independent of the frontend.

## Thoughts of improvement

- More test cases.
- Add typescript.
- Add error handling.
